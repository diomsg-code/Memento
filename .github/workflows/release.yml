# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.

  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want

    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
