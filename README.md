# Memento

Memento is an addon that automatically takes screenshots of specific events. The following events are currently supported (more events are planned):

*   Achievements (personal achievements, as well as reached achievement criteria and guild achievements)*
*   Boss fight (victory and wipe)
*   Player vs. Player (Duel, Arena & Battleground)
*   Level-up
*   Player death
*   Player login

*\* Achievements are not available in 'Classic'*

### Features

*   Each event can be activated separately
*   The user interface can be automatically hidden for the screenshot and a small success notification is displayed instead (Note: The user interface cannot be hidden automatically during a combat and in this case, the screenshot is taken with the user interface)
*   After triggering an event, a delay can be set for creating the screenshot
*   Boss killing will be saved and you can choose whether a screenshot should be taken again for a boss that has already been killed
*   If another character has already earned an achievement, a screenshot can optionally be prevented
*   Small statistical overview of how many screenshots have already been created by Memento
*   Supported languages: English, German
*   Supported versions: 'Classic', 'Cataclysm Classic' and 'Retail'
